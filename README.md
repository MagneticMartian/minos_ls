# minos_ls
 
I was too lazy to figure out some of the issues in badls in terms of C. So, I wrote a bash wrapper around it and changed the name.

badls does not play nice with broken symlinks.

This is known to work on Linux Mint 20. But, it does not work on Void Linux with glibc or Arch Linux either.
